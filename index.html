      <h4>Customer Discovery</h4>
      <p><b>How did we identify the problem?</b></p>
      <p>World hunger and food waste are two of the biggest and most paradoxical problems of our world. There is probably no immediate solution to any of them, but any step that goes towards solving at least a small part of them is valuable. Even if the biggest problem regarding hunger and food diversity happens in Africa, it can be seen at different levels in every society. Romania is not an exception. Eating at a restaurant is a luxury service for a big part of the people living in Romania and we would like to make it at least affordable from time to time for as many people as possible. Apart from that, most of the students rely on the food packages that they receive from home and on the food they find in the universities’ cafeterias. While those are very valuable things to have, we think that they may want to try a different meal than what they usually have from a higher rated place such as a restaurant.</p>
      <p>A lot of restaurants cook food in big quantities both because it is more tasteful and also because it wastes less resources (electricity), but time of the cooks especially as it is usually unfeasible to cook the same dish 9 times in the same day in small portions for each customer that asks for that specific meal. As a result, this leads to food that is not actually sold because there were not enough customers that ordered it. As restaurants have to obey to QoS policies, most of the food they prepare one day is not going to be good to serve the next day as well. Not only that, but in order to gain a name in the overcrowded market of restaurants, freshness is usually one of the main things that customers look at when judging their food. The conclusion of the two previous points is that a lot of restaurants are faced with the decision of throwing very good meals or aliments just because they were not able to sell them.</p>
      <p><b>What is the solution we thought of?</b></p>
      <p>Our team hopes to come as a liaison between the two sides of the problem. Of course, for restaurants it would be more profitable to sell the actual food, even at a lower price rather than throwing it away. While there may be some people questioning the quality of the food at the end of the day, there will be also a lot of people we think that would embrace buying this food at a lower price as price is in general the biggest cause why people don’t order from a restaurant. Most of the people in Romania, and in the world in general don’t cook at home food that they eat only one day, so we believe that they won’t have a problem with the food being prepared at a previous point in the day rather than when they ask for it. As a result we thought of creating an application that offers restaurants the opportunity to list what products they have left at the end of the day and what price. Customers will check the menus and will decide if they want to order something that they would normally would not be able to. There will also be a form of rating the food that was received and the restaurant, so that we can hold the restaurants accountable for the food that they provide. One point of concern that needs to be addressed after analyzing the customers’ wishes is the way the food is going to be delivered to the customers.</p>
      <p><b>What is the customer discovery plan?</b></p>
      <p>We had some discussions in order to determine what customer segments we believe will be the most interested in this type of application that we provide. Then, we talked about what is the easiest way to reach them and also if we can make some conclusions that would apply for all the segments identified previously based on some that are easier to get to. After getting the data from a significant number of people, we will make an analysis to better determine if the conclusions match our expectations. As social media is so big these days and accessible to most of the people in Romania, we thought this is the best and easiest way to start our investigations. During our investigations we not only want to test that the application may be useful, but also that the premises that we started from are correct. Last, but not least we would like to gain some more in depth data through our questions about the segments that we test the idea on so that we can observe some red herring or preconceptions that we made.</p>
      <p><b>Customer discovery process and results.</b></p>
      <p>In order to determine the customer segments we tried to identify the main cause why people don’t eat at restaurants. It was quite obvious to us that the main reason should be that the prices are relatively high. Even if people who earn a lot of money do not eat every day at the restaurant the lower the salary, the more rare people go to restaurants. We thought that the application may have customers from all the societal classes (because even rich people enjoy bargains), but the main segments would be the ones with lower salaries or people who do not have a stable income. We determined that students from various universities may be a good indicator to test on, as most of them don’t work and they also come from different classes. As a result, we believe that they may give a good evidence of what people with the same traits to which it was harder for us to have access to. We also tried to get access to people from corporate environments that would normally afford to eat a normal meal at a restaurant. This would give us a good idea if this segment of people would also like the idea behind our application.</p>
      <p>In order to reach the people that have been mentioned above, we created an online form that we sent to our friends from other universities. We required their help in order to pass it forward so that we have access to a wider range of students. Those of us who are currently working sent the form to their colleagues at work. As a result, we managed to reach a respectable number of over 100 responses from the two environments.</p>
      <p>The results were quite rejoicing for us. 77.9% of our respondents eat food from a restaurant less than twice a week and in a proportion of 58.9% they don’t eat more because they consider the food to be too expensive. This came as a confirmation for the presumption that we have made before. We also asked them how variant is the food they eat on a weekly basis and most of them responded that they eat moderately variate food. This makes us think that they would enjoy eating from a restaurant because they tend to offer food that you may not normally cook.</p>
      <p>The biggest positive was that 64.2% of the respondents said that they would enjoy eating food that would otherwise be thrown away by the restaurants at the end of the day. When breaking it down to the people that do not currently have a job, about 73% of them would like to benefit from our application. This also confirms our belief that people who have a lower income or do not have a stable income would enjoy this type of application. It came as a pleasant surprise, though that even over half of the people who would normally afford to eat at a restaurant (as people working in IT usually earn a pretty big salary in Romania compared to the average) would not mind eating this food instead of it being thrown away.</p>
      <p>We also asked how much they would be willing to pay for two meals (one costing 30 lei and one costing 80 lei). For the cheaper meal 59.6% would pay over half the price whereas for the more expensive one 52.3% would pay over half. Also, around 90% of the people would be willing to pay around 40% of the price for the meal. This is very important as it is the starting point of talk with the restaurants as well. In order for this application to work, a common ground needs to be met in terms of the price asked for the meals as this was the main problem in the first place.</p>
      <p>The last thing that the form revealed was that people are in general not willing to go and pick up the food but would rather have it delivered. This may be a potential drawback as we may have to focus in the first place on restaurants that have a delivery system in place, partner with a delivery company such as Glovo, Food Panda or Uber Eats or create a similar delivery system.</p>
      <p>The product is not yet ready for customer validation. The next step that needs to be done is to go and talk with the persons that represent the other side of the application, the restaurant owners. We have a pretty clear view about what customers expect from our application and we can use this information when proposing it to the restaurants. Unfortunately, this is a bit harder as none of us has any connections in this world and we are still waiting for some e-mail responses so that we can set some brief face to face discussions. We would like to check that our premises are correct in terms of the food that gets wasted and the money that it could generate. Not only that, but we need to check their expectations in terms of price. We also need to make a financial plan that would show how much we would be able to earn from this types of deals between the customers and the restaurant. This needs to be negotiated with the owners as well. Only after these steps are finished we would be able to move on to create a landing page and start working on the MVP.</p>
